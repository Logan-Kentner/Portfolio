Interesting things
I am going to look at some interesting datasets and draw some interesting conclusions from them by making nice graphs. 
Using a dataset of Traffic Violations from Montgomery County in Maryland, we can see what car makes and models are getting into the most trouble and what kind they get into. 

# To begin with this dataset isn't the greatest with lots of missing values and inconsistent user inputs.
# To organize it I split each Make into its own data frame, using the most common spellings input by the officers or clerks.
